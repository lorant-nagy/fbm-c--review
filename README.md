# Fractional Brownian Motion (fBM) C Implementation Review
This project aims to validate the correctness of a C implementation of fractional Brownian motion (fBM) by checking its outputs against theoretical probability grounds. The implementation itself is included in the project, see `include/fbm.h`, and this review focuses solely on the validation process and results.
